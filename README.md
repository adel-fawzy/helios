# Helios

**Helios** is a lightweight C++ framework for building **modular**, **non-blocking**, and **event-driven** systems.  

It provides:
- A clean **Module API** for writing asynchronous, cooperative components  
- A fast, type-safe **Event Bus** for publish/subscribe messaging  
- A minimal runtime that enables highly decoupled system architectures  
- A foundation suitable for **robotics**, **autonomy**, **simulation**, **embedded systems**, or any reactive application

Helios is designed to be simple, composable, and easy to integrate into larger projects.
